# Markdoc

A markdown to html converter with sequence diagram and flowchart support. Generating documents including diagrams has advantages:

- Docs can be checked into version control like source code, and can compare changes effectively as it is all text
- Making and updating diagrams using drawing software is slow

It converts markdown codeblocks for diagrams using [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) and [plotutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils). Pseudocode to Graphviz is inspired by this [gist](https://gist.github.com/antimatter15/1841460). Pseudocode is converted to dot file and then Graphviz's `dot` program converts it to vector image. Sequence diagram uses `sequence.pic` macros from [umlgraph](http://www.umlgraph.org/doc/seq-intro.html) to convert sequence diagram code to plotutls' pic format. Plotutils' `pic2plot` program generates vector image from the pic.

## System requirements

- Ruby 1.9.2 and up
- Graphviz(tested with dot version 2.38.0)
- Plotutls(tested with pic2plot 2.6)

### OS X

`brew install graphviz plotutls`

### Linux(deb)

`apt-get install graphviz plotutls`


## Installing

`gem install markdoc`

For bundler add `gem markdoc` to your Gemfile.


## Usage

`markdoc document.md > document.html`

Generated html includes inline svg diagrams, eliminating need for attached image files.

### Pseudocode blocks

Currently it supports only `if` branch logic, but you can achieve a lot with it. Include codeblock with `pseudo` language in your markdown.

<pre>
```pseudo
visit registration page
enter email address
if new user
  fill in registration form
  submit
  if validation error
    fix registration form
    review the fix
    submit
  else
    submit
  end
else
  enter password
  if password wrong
    ask password again
  else
    good to go
  end
  confirm account info
end
confirm registration info
```
</pre>

Or you could compile individual pseudocode to vector image.

### Sequence diagram

Include codeblock with `sequence` language in your markdown.

<pre>
```sequence
Student = Actor
P = Partner Site
App = Web App
Api = Reg API

Student -> P : Choose course(S)
P -> Api : Issue key for(S)
P <~ Api : Registration key(K)
P -> App : Register with key(K)
Student <~ App : Registration form
Student -> App : Fill the form(F)
App : Save the form(F)
App -> Api : Register(K, F) # New API
Api : Create course
App <~ Api : Course details(C)
App : Save(C)
Student <~ App : Show course summary
Student -> Api : Click study button
Student <~ Api : Show mypage
```
</pre>

Or you could compile individual sequence diagram to vector image.
